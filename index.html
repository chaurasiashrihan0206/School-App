                      Delhi Public School Varanasi functions under the aegis of Delhi Public School Society that is recognized throughout the world for its progressive approach and commitment to excellence in the field of education. Distinction and diversity are the twin-hallmark of its philosophy; educational leadership and scholarly achievement- its mission.
Delhi Public School Varanasi is modeled on the concept of providing holistic education so as to promote an overall social, physical and mental development of each child. A meticulously planned and flawlessly executed curriculum forms the basic framework that helps shape each individual as per the learning style. The entire teaching learning pattern is child friendly and interactive, thus making the entire process engaging and creating learners for life.
                      We also believe that each child is different, born with a unique set of natural abilities and thus strive to develop their individual cognitive skills by encouraging them in all respects. We aim to go all out to provide the best opportunities to our students to gain prowess in sports, performing and visual arts, oratory skills, art or other skills of their interest. Apart from this, we at DPS Varanasi also stress very seriously upon environment conservation and protection. We make sure that our students are aware of their responsibilities towards maintenance of the ecological balance through the various activities that we have amalgamated with the curriculum and conduct all through the year.
